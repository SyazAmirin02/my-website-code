Hello!
==============
I made a basic website today [24/11/2016] and I really want your comment about my website espicially the anchor tag. I don't know what to do. It just really confusing. So I publish two seperate files. One is HTML and another one is CSS. I just learned HTML yesterday so it's a little hard to figure out.
<hr>
The link is killing me so I really hope that I can fix that. Also, this is my first time I using GitHub so it's a little hard to navigate but still training :)
